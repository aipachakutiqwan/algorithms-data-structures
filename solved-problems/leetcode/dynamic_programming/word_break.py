'''
Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict,
return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.
Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

        Solved with Dynamic programming approach.
        Given n as the length of s, m as the length of wordDict, 
        and k as the average length of the words in wordDict
        Time Complexity: O(n*m*k)
                         There are n states of dp(i). Because of memoization, 
                         we only calculate each state once. To calculate a state, 
                         we iterate over m words, and for each word perform some substring operations which costs O(k). 
                         Therefore, calculating a state costs O(mâ‹…k), and we need to calculate O(n) states.
        Space Complexity: O(n)
                         The data structure we use for memoization and the recursion call stack can use up to O(n) space.
