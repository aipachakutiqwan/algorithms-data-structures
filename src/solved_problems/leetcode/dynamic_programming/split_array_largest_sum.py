Given an integer array nums and an integer m, 
split nums into m non-empty subarrays such that the largest sum of any subarray is minimized.

Return the minimized largest sum of the split.

A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.

        Here N is the length of the array and M is the number of subarrays allowed.
        Time complexity: O(NË†2*M)
        Each state is defined by the values currIndex and subarrayCount. 
        As such, there are N*M possible states, and we must visit almost every state in order to solve the original problem. 
        Each state (subproblem) requires O(N) time because we have a for loop from currIndex to N - subarrayCount. 

        Space complexity: O(N*M)
        The memoization results are stored in the table memory with size N*M.
        Also, stack space in the recursion is equal to the maximum number of active functions. 
        The maximum number of active functions can be equal to M as we only make a recursive call 
        when splitting the array and we do not make a recursive call when there is only 1 subarray remaining. 
        Hence, the space complexity is equal to O(N*M).
