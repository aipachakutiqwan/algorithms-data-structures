'''
An attendance record for a student can be represented as a string where each character signifies 
whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. 
The record only contains the following three characters:

'A': Absent.
'L': Late.
'P': Present.
Any student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the following criteria:

The student was absent ('A') for strictly fewer than 2 days total.
The student was never late ('L') for 3 or more consecutive days.
Given an integer n, return the number of possible attendance records of 
length n that make a student eligible for an attendance award. 
The answer may be very large, so return it modulo 109 + 7.

        Solved using Top-Down Dynamic Programming with Memoization.
        Time complexity: O(n)
        Our recursive function will only evaluate n*2*3 unique sub-problems due to memorization.
        So, this approach will take O(6â‹…n)=O(n) time.
        Space complexity: O(n)
        We initialized an additional array memo of size n*2*3 that takes O(n) space.
        The recursive call stack will also take O(n) space in the worst-case.
        So, this approach will take O(6*n + n)=O(n) space.
